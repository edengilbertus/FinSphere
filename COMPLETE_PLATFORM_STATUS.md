## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
The platform now supports both Firebase authentication and direct authentication (development mode):

1. **Firebase Authentication** (Production)
   - User registers/logs in via Firebase Auth
   - Frontend obtains Firebase ID token
   - Token is verified by backend
   - JWT tokens generated for API access

2. **Direct Authentication** (Development)
   - User registers with email/password directly
   - Credentials stored securely in database
   - JWT tokens generated for API access

### API Structure
All endpoints follow the `/api/v1/` prefix convention:

- `/api/v1/auth` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/v1/users` - User management
- `/api/v1/feed` - Social feed
- `/api/v1/messages` - Messaging system
- `/api/v1/loans` - Loan management
- `/api/v1/follow` - Follow relationships
- `/api/v1/upload` - File uploads
- `/api/v1/savings` - Savings features

### Environment Configuration
Both frontend and backend use proper environment variables:

- Development mode detections
- API URL configuration
- Firebase configuration
- Socket.IO URL configuration
